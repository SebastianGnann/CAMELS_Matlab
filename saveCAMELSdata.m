%% saveCAMELSdata - saves various CAMELS datasets as struct files
%
%   This script loads various CAMELS datasets and saves them as Matlab 
%   struct files for easy use in Matlab. The timeseries are loaded only for 
%   the period in which all data are available (typically, streamflow data
%   are the shortest time series and therefore all other time series are
%   shortened to match the streamflow time series). Note that this script
%   can be slow and requires sufficient RAM.
%   
%   Links to the different CAMELS datasets are given below and instructions
%   where to place the datasets are given below.

%% Data location and directories
% The code assumes that all the data are stored in the directory that we
% are in when we run the code. That is, when we run the code while being
% in the directory that contains CAMELS_Matlab (this repository), then the 
% CAMELS data files should also be in this directory. For example, if we 
% work in the main Matlab directory (here MATLAB), our folder structure 
% might look as follows:
%
% MATLAB/... (this is the directory we are in)
% MATLAB/CAMELS_Matlab (this repository contains the code we want to run)
% MATLAB/CAMELS_US (this folder contains CAMELS US data)
%                 
% If we want to use a different folder structure, we have to adjust the
% paths. 
% We need to add the CAMELS_Matlab repository to the Matlab path, so that
% we can work with relative paths. 
mydir = 'CAMELS_Matlab';
addpath(genpath(mydir));

%% CAMELS US
% First, we need to download and extract the CAMELS US data from:
% https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels
% From the link above we can download six different folders. We need 3 
% of them to run this script:
% basin_timeseries_v1p2_modelOutput_daymet (CAMELS time series meteorology, observed flow, meta data (.zip))
% basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow (CAMELS time series Daymet forced model output (.zip))
% camels_attributes_v2.0 (CAMELS Attributes (.zip))
% The data should be stored in a folder named CAMELS_US located in the same
% directory as CAMELS_Matlab.

% Loading and saving the data might take a few minutes.
save_struct = true;
saveCAMELSstruct_US(save_struct); 

% Alternatively, we could also just load the struct file without saving it.
% save_struct = false;
% CAMELS_US_data = saveCAMELSstruct_US(save_struct); 

%% CAMELS GB 
% First, we need to download and extract the CAMELS GB data from:
% https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/8344e4f3-d2ea-44f5-8afa-86d2987543a9
% From the link above we can download the CAMELS GB data all at once. 
% The data should be stored in a folder named CAMELS_GB located in the same
% directory as CAMELS_Matlab.

% Loading and saving the data might take a few minutes.
save_struct = true;

%% CAMELS BR 
% First, we need to download and extract the CAMELS BR data from:
% https://zenodo.org/record/3964745
% From the link above we can download 15 different folders. We need 5 of
% them to run this script (each contain multiple files):

% files. We need 3 folders/files to run this script:
% CAMELS_AUS/03_streamflow (contains streamflow time series)
% CAMELS_AUS/05_hydrometeorology (contains meteorological time series)
% CAMELS_AUS_Attributes-Indices_MasterTable (contains catchment attributes)
% The data should be stored in a folder named CAMELS_AUS located in the 
% same directory as CAMELS_Matlab.

% Loading and saving the data might take a few minutes.
save_struct = true;
saveCAMELSstruct_AUS(save_struct);

% Alternatively, we could also just load the struct file without saving it.
% save_struct = false;
% CAMELS_AUS_data = saveCAMELSstruct_AUS(save_struct);
